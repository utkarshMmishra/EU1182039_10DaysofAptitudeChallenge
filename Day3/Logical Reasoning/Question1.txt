1. He walks 20m in east and then after walking 20m in right he again walks
   4m in left which is east direction. Hence he walked 24m in east       direction and 20m in south direction that forms a right angle triangle.
   By Pythagoras theorem
   dist = sqrt(20^2 + 24^2)
        = sqrt(976)
        = 4*sqrt(61)

2. Shadow of ramesh was falling to his right in evening that is towards    west.
   Since Ramesh and suresh were facing each other hence suresh was facing    north diretion.
