some plants --> roots
some roots --> branches
all leaves --> branches

The first 2 sentence concludes some plants are branches
The 2nd sentence concludes some roots are branches
Since all leaves are branches that means all branches are also leaves
Hence some plants are leaves
Since all leaves are branches hence no plant is a branch

Hence the answer is all of above
