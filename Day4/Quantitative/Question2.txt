1. Girls - 16.8 years
   Boys - 17.9 years
   Average - 17.4 years
   Girls= 17.4-16.8 = 0.6
   Boys= 17.9-17.4 = 0.5
   Clearly boys : girls = 6:5

2. Let the total distance = 1200km
   hence 400km is travelled at speed of 25km/hr
         300km is travelled at speed of 30km/hr and
         500km is travelled at speed of 50km/hr

   Total time taken = (400/25)+(300/30)+(500/50)
		    = 36 hrs

   Average speed = total distance/total time
                 = 1200/36
                 =33.5 km/hr
